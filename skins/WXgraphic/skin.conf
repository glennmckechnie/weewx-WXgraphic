    # The names of these variables are the same as those in the values they
    # populate, in config.txt.tmpl - or the generated config.txt file that is
    # used with index.php (was wxgraphic.php) file on your web server.
    # For complete instructions, and also other configuration settings then
    # read and understand config.txt.tmpl and README.txt and what changes are
    # allowed there.
    #
    # A default setup sends a data file to the wxgraphic/DATA directory on
    # your web server as wxgraphic_weewx.txt. If you have a clientraw file then
    # see the section below [[Clientraw]] as you can use that.
    #
    # This script now includes a 'custom' setting (def write_custom). Use and
    # adjust that to suit a custom image of your choosing, rather than replacing
    # an existing file. As always, the choice is yours - just choose wisely, and
    # make backups!

    # style (shape) of image.
    # options are banner (468x60), banner_big (500x80), avatar (100x100),
    # default (150x150) or custom (currently at 480x97)

    image_format = "png" #  png, gif, jpeg # default is png

    # the option exists to change the font style. See notes in config.txt.tmpl
    # for the instructions. The default is to use the inbuilt GD fonts.
    # If you choose to use a different font, the following are included as
    # examples. You may lose the anti_alias feature, and the physical layout
    # will obvously change but you can take it from there - php edits will be
    # required.

    # degrees C?

    # used for the forecast icons - clientraw.txt and VDS style files apparently
    # have the bulk of them.
    # The weewx generated file ( wxgraphic_weewx.txt) does not have the values
    # in it - it is set to 'blank' but setting curr_cond_icon = 'yes' will
    # display a day / night icon even if you don't have the previous formats.
    # The default is to always display it ie:- 'yes'
    #curr_cond_icon = 'no' # options are 'yes' or 'no'

    # below

    # on the image size.
    # It is useful when embedding in html and a link to your site is used in
    # the embed code
    additional_text = 'WeeWX' # default was "Click for more" ie: the image will
                              # take you somewhere... when mouse clicks image

    # For display purposes only ie:- just a label
    # time_format = "24HR"  # AMPM, 24HR  # default is 24HR

    [[Extras]]

    # The separator (dsv) between data in the wxgraphic_weewx.txt file defaults
    # to a semi-colon  ;
    # This can be changed below IF required, It started out as a comma (,) bu
    # that doesn't work with decimal commas. It became a space ' ' but that has
    # doesn't work with AM PM time formats so now we use the ';'
    # Change it only if you need to, and don't use an under score or colon as
    # they are reserved characters !
    # delimiter_dsv = ';'

    # wxg_debug = '0' # 0 or 5 for some debug info

[Units]
    [[Ordinates]]
