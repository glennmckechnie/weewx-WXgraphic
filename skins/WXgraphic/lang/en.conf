# unit_system = us, or metric, or metricwx!
# enabling the unit system here is a coarse approach. You have finer control
# using groups - the [[[Units]]] [[[[Groups]]]] sections in weewx.conf Either
# under [[Defaults]] or under your [[skin]]

[Units]

    # The following section overrides the label used for each type of unit
    [[Labels]]

        # These are singular, plural
        meter             = " meter",  " meters"
        day               = " day",    " days"
        hour              = " hour",   " hours"
        minute            = " minute", " minutes"
        second            = " second", " seconds"

    [[Ordinates]]

        # Ordinal directions. The last one should be for no wind direction
        directions = N, NNE, NE, ENE, E, ESE, SE, SSE, S, SSW, SW, WSW, W, WNW, NW, NNW, N/A
