# Generally want a metric system for the German language:
# unit_system = metricwx
# but enabling the unit system here is a coarse approach. You have finer control
# using groups - the [[[Units]]] [[[[Groups]]]] sections in weewx.conf Either
# under [[Defaults]] or under your [[skin]]

[Units]

    # The following section overrides the label used for each type of unit
    [[Labels]]

        # These are singular, plural
        meter = " m"
        day = " Tag", " Tage"
        hour = " Stunde", " Stunden"
        minute = " Minute", " Minuten"
        second = " Sekunde", " Sekunden"

    [[Ordinates]]

        # Ordinal directions. The last one should be for no wind direction
        directions = N, NNO, NO, ONO, O, OSO, SO, SSO, S, SSW, SW, WSW, W, WNW, NW, NNW, N/A
